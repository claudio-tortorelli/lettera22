# lettera22
Lettera22 is a toolset for automated text processing that transforms raw text files into stylish artifacts (eg HTML).

It consists of a series of command line tools (CLI), each of which has a specific role in the processing and management 
of published texts. A portable version of the well-known Notepad ++ (npp) editor is integrated in the package, 
to support the text writing and contextual start of the tools.

Actually no sources are provided but you can download and test current binary version.
Sorry but no translated documentation is currently ready: the tool is meant for Italian writers ;)
I supplied an "hello world" in the Wiki to give a basic overview of the software.
